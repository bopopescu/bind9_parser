This is the /var/lib/bind/internal subdirectory.

This subdirectory contains bind9 zone data files.

Zone data files that used to be in /etc/bind are now in here under master
subdirectory because they stay together with other zone data files.

Zone files are stored in separate subdirectory by types:

  master -  Contains text-based zone files that are editable and
            controlled here by this nameserver.

  slave -   Contains binary-based zone files supplied and maintained
            by other master nameservers

  dynamic - Contains named daemon-generated zone files that contains
            dynamically created resource records (RRs) such as DNSSEC,
            NSSEC,  RRSIG.

  root -    Contains the Root (".") DNS zone file that contains all
            the top-level domain (TLD) names (like .com, .org, or .net).
            This root zone file is a separate directory from 'master'
            for added security.
