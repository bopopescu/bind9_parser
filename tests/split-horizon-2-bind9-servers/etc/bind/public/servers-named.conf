//// Bind9 'server' clause
////
//// Defines the properties or behavior this server will use when
//// accessing or responding to a defined remote server.
//// May be nested in a view clause.
//
// Customized for public network
//
//// The server statement defines characteristics to be associated
//// with a remote name server. If a prefix length is specified,
//// then a range of servers is covered. Only the most specific
//// server clause applies regardless of the order in named.conf.


//// The server statement can occur at the top level of the
//// configuration file or inside a view statement. If a view
//// statement contains one or more server statements, only those
//// apply to the view and any top-level ones are ignored. If a
//// view contains no server statements, any top-level server
//// statements are used as defaults.
