= ROOT SERVERS =
Root Servers used to be called 'root.hint', 'named.root', 'named.cache', but
is now called 'db.cache' and no longer resides in /etc/bind
but resides in /var/lib/bind as /etc/bind are no longer writeable
in accordance with the Linux File System Standard.

Also, DNSSEC now signs (and thusly updates) all zone files so 
writeable files can only be done under /var/lib/bind directory.

Pick up the latest root servers here, at least monthly:

    https://www.internic.net/domain/

Optionally, use a cron job to fetch and update 
this '/var/lib/bind/db.cache' file.  But that'd be a poor security risk.

Or you can let bind9 networkly fetch the db.cache file content at 
bind9 startup and leave it as memory-resident storage.
